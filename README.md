The Kinks
Introduction:
This is the first front-end web-development project i have attempted.  The aim of this project is to promote a 1960s rock band called The Kinks to gain more accessibility to fans around the world and  to increase the sales from their newest music album, future tours and private hires.  This is a static front-end web development incorporating skills learned from HTML and CSS3 taught by Code Institute.
